<h1>NoteBot</h1>

- I’m @NoteeeeeeeeeeBot (Note or NoteBot also works)
- I'm a Student Studying Game Development.
- I'm Currently Learning and improving at C#, C, C++, GDscript and Rust.
- I'm have experience and have studied extensively Python, HTML + CSS and Brainfuck(Genuinely).
- I use a combination of Visual Studio(For C# and C++), VSCode(Heavily Modified for Other languages or developing on Linux) and Vim(for really fast edits) when programming.

A Vast Majority of my Repos are going to be private due to small test projects or Uni Projects but feel free to throw out advice on larger projects
